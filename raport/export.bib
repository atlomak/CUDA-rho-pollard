   abstract = {The idea of the Internet of Things (IoT) network has been created as a result of the coordination of different developments, constant handling, intellectual capacity, item sensors, and inserted frameworks. Recently, IoT devices have made big impact on industrial critical infrastructures. However, security and privacy of IoT critical infrastructure still, is the big concern. Therefore, to address the vulnerabilities of the existing frameworks, this paper proposes a cryptographically secure privacy-preserving authenticated key agreement scheme for a IoT network through an elliptical curve, which generates a mutual key between the user and the device. The safety review and systematic testing of the system using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) method have been carried out to show the protection quality of the system. The quality review reveals that the scheme is lightweight and effective. By comparison, the proposed scheme is found to be comparable to the related works, and the current framework offers additional features such as Key Compromise Impersonate Attack Resistance, Established Session Key Protection, Key Replication Resistance, in addition to existing features.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) enables the interconnection of physical and virtual objects that are managed by various types of hardware, software, and communication technologies. The large-scale deployment of IoT is actually enabling smart cities, smart factories, smart health, and many other applications and initiatives all over the world. Indeed, according to a recent Gartner study, 50 billion connected objects will be deployed by 2020. IoT will make our cities and daily applications smart. However, IoT technologies also open up multiple risks and privacy issues. Due to hardware limitations of IoT objects, implementing and deploying robust and efficient security and privacy solutions for the IoT environment remains a significant challenge. One-time password (OTP) is an authentication scheme that represents a promising solution for IoT and smart cities environments. We extend the OTP principle and propose a novel approach of OTP generation that relies on elliptic curve cryptography and isogeny in order to ensure IoT security. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach with a real implementation and compared its performance with two other approaches namely, hash message authentication code-based OTP and time-based OTP. The performance results obtained demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in terms of security and performance.},

We study alternative walks that can be efficiently applied to compute discrete logarithms. We introduce a class of walks that lead to the same performance as expected in the random case. We show that this holds for arbitrarily large prime group orders, thus making Pollard's rho method for prime group orders about 20% faster than before.},

   abstract = {A simple new technique of parallelizing methods for solving search problems which seek collisions in pseudorandom walks is presented. This technique can be adapted to a wide range of cryptanalytic problems which can be reduced to finding collisions. General constructions are given showing how to adapt the technique to finding discrete logarithms in cyclic groups, finding meaningful collisions in hash functions, and performing meet-in-the-middle attacks such as a known-plaintext attack on double encryption. The new technique greatly extends the reach of practical attacks, providing the most cost-effective means known to date for defeating: the small subgroup used in certain schemes based on discrete logarithms such as Schnorr, DSA, and elliptic curve cryptosystems; hash functions such as MD5, RIPEMD, SHA-1, MDC-2, and MDC-4; and double encryption and three-key triple encryption. The practical significance of the technique is illustrated by giving the design for three $10 million custom machines which could be built with current technology: one finds elliptic curve logarithms in GF(2 155) thereby defeating a proposed elliptic curve cryptosystem in expected time 32 days, the second finds MD5 collisions in expected time 21 days, and the last recovers a double-DES key from two known plaintexts in expected time 4 years, which is four orders of magnitude faster than the conventional meet-in-the-middle attack on double-DES. Based on this attack, double-DES offers only 17 more bits of security than single-DES.},

This challenge is to compute an elliptic-curve discrete logarithm on a Koblitz curve over F 2 131. Optimizations have reduced the cost of the computation to approximately 2 77 bit operations in 2 61 iterations. GPUs are not designed for fast binary-field arithmetic; they are designed for highly vectorizable floating-point computations that fit into very small amounts of static RAM.

The resulting GPU software performs more than 63 million iterations per second, including 320 million F 2 131 multiplications per second, on a $500 NVIDIA GTX 295 graphics card.

   abstract = {Elliptic Curve Discrete Log Problem (ECDLP) is the underlying basis of many popular Public Key Scheme like Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal. The strength of such public key schemes is based on the difficulty of solving the ECDLP. The best method for solving the ECDLP has time complexity exponential in the size of the underlying field. ECDLP based cryptosystems are popular because they provide good security at key sizes much smaller than number theoretical Public Key Schemes like RSA cryptosystem. Elliptic curve cryptosystem based on ECDLP are also present in the list of recommended algorithms for use by NIST and NSA. Since ECDLP based cryptosystems are in widespread use, continuous efforts on monitoring the effectiveness of new attacks or improvements to existing attacks on ECDLP over large field is important. Using the parallel Pollard's method to solve the ECDLP efficiently is one of the prime concerns. Use of different parallel architectures like cluster computing (MPI), GPGPU, FPGA cluster increases the effectiveness of attack.

   abstract = {This paper chronicles our experiences using CUDA to implement a parallelized variant of Pollard's rho algorithm to solve discrete logarithms in groups with cryptographically large moduli but smooth order using commodity GPUs. We first discuss some key design constraints imposed by modern GPU architectures and the CUDA framework, and then explain how we were able to implement efficient arbitrary-precision modular multiplication within these constraints. Our implementation can execute roughly 51.9 million 768-bit modular multiplications per second-or a whopping 840 million 192-bit modular multiplications per second-on a single Nvidia Tesla M2050 GPU card, which is a notable improvement over all previous results on comparable hardware. We leverage this fast modular multiplication in our implementation of the parallel rho algorithm, which can solve discrete logarithms modulo a 1536-bit RSA number with a 2 55-smooth totient in less than two minutes. We conclude the paper by discussing implications to discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems, and by pointing out how efficient implementations of parallel rho (or related algorithms) lead to trapdoor discrete logarithm groups; we also point out two potential cryptographic applications for the latter. Our code is written in C for CUDA and PTX; it is open source and freely available for download online.},

   abstract = {This paper reports a successful demonstration of Pollard rho algorithm on a hardware-software co-integrated platform. It targets the Elliptic curve discrete logarithmic problem (ECDLP) for a NIST-standardized curve over 112- bit prime field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on fully functional, demonstrated hardware-accelerated ECC cryptanalytic engine. Our implementation uses a highly optimized software implementation as reference [1] and develops a hardware version of it. This paper also describes a novel, generalized architecture for polynomial-basis multiplication over prime field and its extension to a dedicated square module. The resulting modular multiplier completes the multiplication within 14 clock cycles, which is 2.5X lower latency over earlier work [2]. We demonstrate our design on a Nallatech FSB-Compute platform with Virtex-5 FPGA. The implementation efficiently utilizes the dedicated DSP48 cores available in the used FPGA device. The measured performance of the resulting design is 151 cycles per Pollard rho step at 100MHz and upto 660K iterations per second per ECC core. With a multi-core implementation of our design, the performance can be comparable with that of the software implementation on a Cell processor [1]. Though the primary target of this implementation is 112-bit prime field, its design strategy can be applied to other prime field moduli. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Since their invention in the mid 1980s, Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems (ECC) have become an alternative to common Public-Key (PK) cryptosystems such as, e.g., RSA. The utilization of Elliptic Curves (EC) in cryptography is very promising because of their resistance against powerful indexcalculus attacks. Providing a similar level of security as RSA, ECC allows for efficient implementation due to a significantly smaller bit size of the operands. It is widely accepted that the only feasible way to attack actual cryptosystems, if at all, is the application of dedicated hardware. In times of continuous technological improvements and increasing computing power, the question of the security of ECC against attacks based on special-purpose hardware and, in particular based on recently emerged low-cost FPGAs, arises. This work presents the first architecture with a corresponding FPGA implementation of an attack against ECC over prime fields. We describe an FPGA-based multi-processing hardware architecture for the Pollard-Rho method which is, to our knowledge, currently the most efficient attack against ECC. The implementation is running on a contemporary low-cost FPGA which allows for a much better cost-performance ratio than conventional CPUs. With the implementation at hand, a fairly accurate estimate about the cost of an FPGA-based attack can be given. We will extrapolate the results on actual ECC key lengths (128 bits and above) and estimate the expected runtimes for a successful attack. Since FPGA-based attacks are out of reach for key lengths exceeding 128 bits, we provide estimates for an ASIC design. Based on our results, currently used elliptic curve cryptosystems (160 bit and above) are infeasible to break with available computational and financial resources. However, some of the security standards proposed by the SECG in [2, 3] become subject to attacks based on low-cost FPGAs. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

   abstract = {Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems (ECC) have gained increasing acceptance in practice due to their significantly smaller bit size of the operands compared to other public-key cryptosystems. Since their computational complexity is often lower than in the case of RSA or discrete logarithm schemes, ECC are often chosen for high performance public-key applications. However, despite a wealth of research regarding high-speed software and high-speed FPGA implementation of ECC since the mid 1990s, providing truly high-performance ECC on readily available (i.e., non-ASIC) platforms remains an open challenge. This holds especially for ECC over prime fields, which are often preferred over binary fields due to standards in Europe and the US. This work presents a new architecture for an FPGA-based ultra high performance ECC implementation over prime fields. Our architecture makes intensive use of the DSP blocks in modern FPGAs, which are embedded arithmetic units actually intended to accelerate digital signal processing algorithms. We describe a novel architecture and algorithms for performing ECC arithmetic and describe the actual implementation of standard compliant ECC based on the NIST primes P-224 and P-256. We show that ECC on Xilinx's Virtex-4 SX55 FPGA can be performed at a rate of more than 37,000 point multiplications per second.

This interest is mainly due to the high level of security with relatively small keys provided by ECC Indeed, no sub-exponential algorithms are known to solve the underlying hard problem: the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm. The aim of this work is to explore the possibilities of dedicated hardware implementing the best known algorithm for generic curves: the parallelized Pollard's p method. This problem has specific constraints and requires therefore new architectures. Four different strategies were investigated with different FPGA families in order to provide the best areatime product, according to the capabilities of the chosen platforms. The approach yielding the best throughput over hardware cost ratio is then fully described and was implemented in order to estimate the cost of an attack. Such results should help to improve the accuracy of the security level offered by a given key size, especially for the shorter parameters proposed for resource constrained devices.

Cryptanalytic attack on ECC system involves solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). The best known algorithm used to solve ECDLP is Pollard's rho method. So far successful attacks on ECC systems were mostly based on distributed computer networks. In this paper a heterogenic (software & hardware) distributed cryptanalytic system is presented. Proposed solution utilizes the concept of distributing computation in network of general purpose computers and specialized hardware units with FPGA structures. Such hybrid system allows for very efficient cryptanalysis of cryptosystems based on elliptic curves. Estimated computation time of attacks on specific curves from Certicom Challenge list using proposed system is presented. Â© 2008 IEEE.},
